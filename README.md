# Game Description
Alive By Dark Night is a two-player horror shooter with a split-screen in which both players take on the roles of a Hunter and a Prey. 
Players can choose to play as a human hunter or a monster from the depths of hell! 
The players will hunt each other based on the in-game Day/Night cycle, in which the monster grows stronger and more dangerous at night while remaining killable during the day. 
The game is over after three rounds, or about ten minutes, and the player with the highest score wins. 
You will need: a companion, Hopefully you made a lot of them during the game jam! A keyboard and mouse, as well as a controller.You'll need a large enough screen and 10 minutes of your time. 
Human, you have the ability to use traps. 
They can be lethal during the day, but only slow the monster down at night. 
You are vulnerable during the day, and you are not strong enough to kill the human; use your wits to survive. Best wishes and happy hunting!
